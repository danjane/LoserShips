    '''test for ratio of two sample Poisson intensities
    If the two Poisson rates are g1 and g2, then the Null hypothesis is
    H0: g1 / g2 = ratio_null
    against one of the following alternatives
    H1_2-sided: g1 / g2 != ratio_null
    H1_larger: g1 / g2 > ratio_null
    H1_smaller: g1 / g2 < ratio_null
    Parameters
    ----------
    count1: int
        Number of events in first sample
    exposure1: float
        Total exposure (time * subjects) in first sample
    count2: int
        Number of events in first sample
    exposure2: float
        Total exposure (time * subjects) in first sample
    ratio: float
        ratio of the two Poisson rates under the Null hypothesis. Default is 1.
    method: string
        Method for the test statistic and the p-value. Defaults to `'score'`.
        Current Methods are based on Gu et. al 2008
        Implemented are 'wald', 'score' and 'sqrt' based asymptotic normal
        distribution, and the exact conditional test 'exact-cond', and its mid-point
        version 'cond-midp', see Notes
    alternative : string
        The alternative hypothesis, H1, has to be one of the following
           'two-sided': H1: ratio of rates is not equal to ratio_null (default)
           'larger' :   H1: ratio of rates is larger than ratio_null
           'smaller' :  H1: ratio of rates is smaller than ratio_null
    Returns
    -------
    stat, pvalue two-sided
    not yet
    #results : Results instance
    #    The resulting test statistics and p-values are available as attributes.
    Notes
    -----
    'wald': method W1A, wald test, variance based on separate estimates
    'score': method W2A, score test, variance based on estimate under Null
    'wald-log': W3A
    'score-log' W4A
    'sqrt': W5A, based on variance stabilizing square root transformation
    'exact-cond': exact conditional test based on binomial distribution
    'cond-midp': midpoint-pvalue of exact conditional test
    The latter two are only verified for one-sided example.
